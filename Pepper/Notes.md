# Notes
  
## 14/4/2022 Choregraphe Worked Succesfully
Was not able to connect to robot through choregraphe. 
### Next steps 
Try to factory reset one Pepper to see if we can connect to it:   https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/support/pepper-naoqi-2-9/7-safety-advanced-operations  
NOTE: REMEMBER TO PLUG IN THE ROBOT WITH THE CORD NOT JUST THE DOCKING STATION  
NOTE: PLEASE REVIEW THIS BEFORE FACTORY RESET https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/support/pepper-naoqi-2-9/troubleshooting/applications-os#start  

## 21/04/2022 Connected to Pepper (Papriko) and used some fun commands on Choregraphe
Now that we have pepper up and running we experimented with the available features on Choregraphe.
Looking into creating customised scripts to upload on Choregraph and feed it into Pepper for next session.
