# Overview

This Choregraphe (v2.5) project makes use of HTML/Javascript to implement the workflow of a welcoming sequence on the Pepper robot. 

To install this package on a Pepper robot, open the [Pepper_TechFest.pml](https://github.com/melhood/Robofield/blob/main/Pepper/Pepper%20Projects/Pepper_TechFest/Pepper_TechFest.pml) file in Choregraphe. Then use the upload to robot feature to send the package to the robot. This will add a launcher entry on the robot's tablet, which will start the behaviour when selected.

OS: Windows & Linux
