# Notes
  
## 14/4/2022 Choregraphe Worked Succesfully
Was not able to connect to robot through choregraphe. 
### Next steps 
Try to factory reset one Pepper to see if we can connect to it:   https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/support/pepper-naoqi-2-9/7-safety-advanced-operations  
NOTE: REMEMBER TO PLUG IN THE ROBOT WITH THE CORD NOT JUST THE DOCKING STATION  
NOTE: PLEASE REVIEW THIS BEFORE FACTORY RESET https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/support/pepper-naoqi-2-9/troubleshooting/applications-os#start
